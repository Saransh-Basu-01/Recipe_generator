API Integration
This app uses a Hugging Face model to generate recipes. The model takes the list of ingredients as input and returns a recipe. Ensure you have a valid Hugging Face API key and proper internet connectivity for the app to function correctly.
To integrate with the Hugging Face API:

The app sends a POST request to the Hugging Face model endpoint with the ingredients.
The response is processed and displayed as a formatted recipe.

Note: Ensure your API key is kept secure and not exposed in the client-side code for production applications.
